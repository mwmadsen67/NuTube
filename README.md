## Video Upload

NuTube utilizes a high performance content storage technology called Active Storage, which allows it's users to upload 4k videos and high quality images, storing them on Amazons S3 cloud storage.

Logged in users can click on the video camera button conveniently located on the header to go to the video upload page. Once there, the user chooses a video from their local storage to upload, as well as a preview image to display as the thumbnail for their video.

Once both files are chosen, the user is shown a page allowing them to input their video's title, description, and posted video length. NuTubers can optionally choose to have a description on their video or not. The user must input the video length in seconds for NuTube to convert into a displayable format.

Once the user clicks the submit button, the page shows a loading icon until the video is fully uploaded, and then the user is directed to the front page of NuTube, prominently displaying their new video as the top recommended video.

## Video Likes and Dislikes

Another feature of NuTube is the ability for users to like and dislike videos.

On each video's page, the total number of likes and dislikes is displayed on the bottom right of the video, allowing users to see the popularity, or notoriety of the selected video within the NuTube community. Logged in users can each like or dislike a video once to give their vote on a video.
